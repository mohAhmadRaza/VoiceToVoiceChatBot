# Whisper and Groq Audio Processing Application

This project is an audio processing application that leverages OpenAI's Whisper for transcription and Groq's AI for generating responses. The application converts the response into speech and allows users to download the audio file.

## Features

- **Transcription**: Converts audio files into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **AI Response**: Generates AI-based responses using Groq's API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the AI response into speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- **Downloadable Audio**: Provides a download option for the generated audio response.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your Groq API key:
   ```plaintext
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

   **Note**: The `.env` file should not be committed to version control for security reasons.

## Usage

1. **Running the Application**:
   Start the application by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Using the Interface**:
   - Upload an audio file using the interface.
   - The application will transcribe the audio, generate a response, convert the response to speech, and provide a downloadable audio file.

## Example Workflow

1. Upload an audio file in the interface.
2. The transcription of the audio is displayed as text.
3. A response is generated based on the transcribed text.
4. The response is converted to audio, which can be played directly or downloaded.
